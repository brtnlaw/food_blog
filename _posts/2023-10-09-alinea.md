Following a day of work, I had dinner at Alinea. The restaurant is tucked in a relatively quiet area of Old Town with an unassuming facade. We were seated at The Gallery where we were brought in to a dimly lit room with a long, communal table filled with glass flora.

</div>

The amuse-bouche assortment was so-so, having a interesting textural contrasts between the crispy tart (itself having popping roe and and the snappy green beans), the softer cake, and the condensed sunflower ball ***(2/5)***. Next, the vegetable wand was interesting to look at, but frankly, I didn't even get to taste this before it was whisked away ***(1.5/5)***. We were also handed a complimentary glass of champagne ***(2/5)***.

Lastly, the garden gazpacho was served to us within a fragile, glass-blown flower with the pistil serving as a spoon. The flowers were extremely interesting to eat out of, enhacing the idea of delicacy, but the soup was not good. The consistency was akin to shaved ice and tasted much too sharp and sour  ***(1/5)***. 

Of note, throughout our meal, there was a large stone fixture of a fountain containing what had been presumed to be water. After some story-telling, the waiter asked for two volunteers to assist in pouring two jugs of liquid into said fountain; I obliged, helping with the creation of a later drink.

</div>

Following this, we were quickly ushered into the kitchen where we witnessed the construction of the cobbler dish. Chefs sliced cured ham, cut precise pieces of peach, and assembled a solid yet forgettable dish. It again featured contrasting textures as well as combined nuttiness, umami, and syrupy-sweetness from the walnut, ham, and peach, respectively ***(3/5)***. To compliment the dish, we were served a sherry from the fountain: our creation from just a few minutes ago ***(2/5)***.

</div>

Upon return to the gallery, the dining room is completely transformed, where it’s well lit and tables are separated. Our first dish is a palm of caviar and walnut, where custom-made glass blown "shells" serve as our plate. Briny and nutty, this was an innovative take to combine all of our senses by involving the tactility of our palms ***(3/5)***. 

Next was a "shot" of apple cider and celery juice in a horseradish shell. Personally, I did not enjoy the sour flavors, but it was at least interesting breaking up the horseradish "wax" shell in my mouth to reveal a cool liquid inside ***(1.5/5)***.

   %}
</div>

The next dish was the classic "Hot Potato Cold Potato," and upon removing the spear, you get a sharp contrast of textures and temperatures in a buttery, comforting, and yet fleeting slurp. The combination of the vichyssoise, Parmesan, truffle and potato forms was very imaginative and it was made clear why this is a staple ***(4.5/5)***.

Next we had the black cod with potato chips and onion and mint dip. It was smoky and soft, and the onion dip was addictive ***(4/5)***.

 The subsequent "sardine" eggplants were quite tough and while an interesting spectacle to behold (common theme), fell short on the flavor department for me. Savory and atop a buttery crisp, it felt difficult to eat ***(1.5/5)***.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 1rem;">

</div>

The biscuit with two types of jam was solid while the squab was perfectly cooked, hitting on its tenderness and flavor. 

The next set of courses were gooseberry themed, and for the uni they again brought out a tactile bowl for an interesting sensation. All three played on the use of sweetness and savoriness, with my only complaint being my desire for a napkin after the chicken wing. The following was another staple, "Truffle Explosion", where we were advised to eat with our mouths shut to get all of the flavor. It lived up to the hype in having more intense notes of truffle than any other dish I've had. It was followed up with another strange looking dish of fried meat on a flaming stick, which was interesting to see and well spiced, but not a standout.

The shortrib with shaved jameed was my first encounter with the Middle Eastern yogurt, but the meat was cooked excellently and melt-in-your-mouth. The parsnip puree was pungent and had crunchy nibs, but somewhat forgettable. 

Dessert was an amazing experience. The first tea served in a tube tasted exactly of Hubba Bubba and set the tone for the playfulness of the following dishes. "Painted Dessert" was a spectacle to behold as lights dimmed and our table was shrouded with dry ice. Additionally, every component was tasty, not too sweet, and the portion sizes were quite large. Lastly, we had a fully edible balloon of apple toffee with helium to play with after.
