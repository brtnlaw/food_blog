<p>Nestled in the West Loop, stepping into Smyth, you are invited into an assuming layout with an open kitchen that lacks the stuffiness of many other Michelin starred restaurants. The wait staff are friendly and the ambience invites an air of warmth. At the time of dining, Smyth had been awarded its third star for the first time.</p>

</div>

<p>To start off, as a precursor to the rest of the courses each with a somewhat Japanese flair, we were presented with the slightly alcoholic, fermented amazake with fruity pineapple notes and a large sprig of pineapple leaf. It was fresh, fruity, and provided good sweetness to begin with <strong><em>(3.5/5)</em></strong>. The tart had a bit of an overwhelmingly herbal flavor with the fennel and dill but these flavors overall went well with the kelp and the prawn, which provided a mushier textural contrast <strong><em>(3/5)</em></strong>. The quail egg dish provided a strong burst of flavor as the yolk exploded while the other ingredients were a bit more muted <strong><em>(3/5)</em></strong>.</p>

</div>

<p>The following two dishes held with more seafood - the Dungeness crab bite was akin to eating fruit with a briny crab aftertaste. The jackfruit largely dictated the texture but there was a good mix of saltiness and sweetness in the bite <strong><em>(3.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The crab custard, almost a chawanmushi, was one of the best courses, fusing a rich crab flavor with passionfruit for intense umami and sweetness in every bite. The consistency was soft and delicate, but very savory. It came with an interesting slanted, wooden spoon to aid in getting all the corners of the square plate <strong><em>(4.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

</div>

<p>From here, if the previous dishes were ocean-themed, the next four seemed to be more land- and earth-themed. The following onion dish was largely forgettable. The onions themselves roasted well and tart, but at the end of the day, they were simply just well prepared onions. The lobster consommé did not provide too much support for flavor <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The caviar dash had a very odd presentation - it was caviar stuck to the side and slowly sliding down into the walnut sauce. In my opinion, this seemed a bit messy and unrefined; we were given almonds and rose butter to alternate enjoying the caviar with, and while they both were pleasant, the rose butter had a much stronger, richer flavor, providing decent contrast <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>.</p>

</div>

<p>We were presented with an intermittent palate cleanser, which was effective and fresh. It combined the apple, eucalyptus, and avocado to provide an earthy dish with a peanut milk bed, a bit like a vegetable ice cream. The flavors were subtle and inoffensive, with the iciness and creaminess standing out <strong><em>(3/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The following asparagus dish fell a bit flat. The cream sauce and purée were just fine, if not a bit tart, and the asparagus tips were properly cooked and nicely textured but lacked much beyond their initial flavor. The inedible spruce was also a bit strange <strong><em>(1.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I was a big fan of the rainbow trout. The meat’s consistency after being cooked was almost gelatinous, in stark contrast to its flaky skin and kombu. Laying atop the congee allowed the rice to soak up much of the sauce and flavor. The soy glaze was sweet and went well with the bed of turnip juice braise <strong><em>(4/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Their next dish was “Lamb in Many Ways,” where the rack was notably delicious and tender while the sausage was unremarkable but savory, meaty, and salty. The fried lamb fat was also crispy <strong><em>(3.5/5)</em></strong>. The milk bread was fresh, fluffy, and warm, covered in a sweet glaze. It accompanied the lamb heart and habañero sauce well, forming a very unique set of ingredients to combine sweetness with spiciness and tang. I was impressed with Smyth’s willingness to try different combinations of ingredients and look to provide contrast in flavors and textures <strong><em>(4/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Onto dessert, the goat cheese texture was just like a perfectly chilled ice cream and the tartness provided by the pineapple with the sweetness of the honey fit together well <strong><em>(3.5/5)</em></strong>. Their banana dish was creative, essentially reconstructing the fruit in novel ways. The custard flavor was strong and we were instructed to bite once into the walnut truffle, finish the “banana,” and finally revisit the truffle, maintaining up its sweetness. This “reconstruction” effectively brought out the banana flavor while rotating with the nuttier truffle mixed well. The sweet, chewy kombu was an interesting touch <strong><em>(4/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>We were presented with ganache “quail eggs” within a woven nest, and while the chocolate part was good, I was not a fan of the strong lemon rind flavor, which was almost overpowering <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>. The graham cracker shot had quite a neutral ganache but the flower flavor was a bit stronger than I would’ve liked. I would’ve preferred they introduce a more leading flavor within the ganache and held out on the number of flowers they put on top <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>. The sea lettuce caramel tasted of seaweed and evoked flavors similar to that of Japanese snacks <strong><em>(3/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Additionally, throughout our meal, the service was especially excellent as left- or right-handedness, towels, and dish explanations were handled with care. It was evident how attentive our waiters and waitresses were even compared to the 3 Michelin star standard.</p>

<p>Following a day of work, I had the opportunity to dine at Alinea. The restaurant is tucked in a relatively quiet area of Old Town with an easily overlooked facade. We were seated at The Gallery where we were brought in to a dimly lit room with a long, communal table filled with glass flora.</p>

</div>

<p>The amuse-bouche assortment was so-so, having a interesting textural contrasts between the crispy tart (itself having popping roe and and the snappy green beans), the softer cake, and the condensed sunflower ball <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>. Next, the vegetable wand was interesting to look at, but frankly, I didn’t even get to taste this before it was whisked away <strong><em>(1.5/5)</em></strong>. We were also handed a complimentary glass of champagne <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the garden gazpacho was served to us within a fragile, glass-blown flower with the pistil serving as a spoon. The flowers were extremely interesting to eat out of, enhacing the idea of delicacy, but the soup was not good. The consistency was akin to shaved ice and tasted much too sharp and sour  <strong><em>(1/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Of note, throughout our meal, there was a large stone fixture of a fountain containing what had been presumed to be water. After some story-telling, the waiter asked for two volunteers to assist in pouring two jugs of liquid into said fountain; I obliged, helping with the creation of a later drink.</p>

<p>Following this, we were quickly ushered into the kitchen where we witnessed the construction of the cobbler dish. Chefs sliced cured ham, cut precise pieces of peach, and assembled a solid yet forgettable dish. It again featured contrasting textures as well as combined nuttiness, umami, and syrupy-sweetness from the walnut, ham, and peach, respectively <strong><em>(3/5)</em></strong>. To compliment the dish, we were served a sherry from the fountain: our creation from just a few minutes ago <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Upon return to the gallery, the dining room is completely transformed, where it’s well lit and tables are separated. Our first dish is a palm of caviar and walnut, where custom-made glass blown “shells” serve as our plate. Briny and nutty, this was an innovative take to combine all of our senses by involving the tactility of our palms <strong><em>(3/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Next was a “shot” of apple cider and celery juice in a horseradish shell. Personally, I did not enjoy the sour flavors, but it was at least interesting breaking up the horseradish “wax” shell in my mouth to reveal a cool liquid inside <strong><em>(1.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The next dish was the classic “Hot Potato Cold Potato,” and upon removing the spear, you get a sharp contrast of textures and temperatures in a buttery, comforting, and yet fleeting slurp. The combination of the vichyssoise, Parmesan, truffle and potato forms was very imaginative and it was made clear why this is a staple <strong><em>(4.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Next we had the black cod with potato chips and onion and mint dip. It was smoky and soft, and the onion dip was addictive <strong><em>(4/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The subsequent “sardine” eggplants were quite tough and while an interesting concept, it fell short on the flavor department for me. Savory and atop a buttery crisp, it felt difficult to eat <strong><em>(1.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The biscuit was warm, buttery, and flaky. The two jams provided good contrast with sweetness, tartness, and richness <strong>(3.5/5)</strong>.</p>

<p>The squab was perfectly cooked, hitting on its tenderness and flavor. It had the right amount of gaminess and the rehydrating jous was rich and umami, providing textural contrast when the crunchy vegetables were applied <strong><em>(4.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The next set of courses were gooseberry themed, and for the uni they again brought out a tactile bowl for an interesting sensation. All three played on the use of sweetness and savoriness, with my only complaint being my desire for a napkin after the chicken wing. Otherwise, the individual ingredients really stood out, with the individual rice granules tasted and the mushrooms having natural fungal flavor and bite <strong><em>(4/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The following was another Alinea classic called the “Truffle Explosion,” where we were advised to eat with our mouths shut to get all of the flavor. This truly lived up to the hype; inside was a decadent amount of truffle juice, with the other ingredients primarily providing texture <strong><em>(4.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This was followed up with a stranger looking dish consisting of a fried meatball attached to a flaming stick. The meatball consisted of numerous different meats, apple, and onion, but for me, the flavors mixed a bit together. The presentation was interesting, if not a little out of place, and the seasoning was done well, but this was not a standout <strong><em>(3/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Next, we were introduced to dishes that relied heavily on parsnip flavor. First, we were presented with a plate of wagyu short rib and various root vegetable chips and mash. Next, we were introduced to a mysterious large white mound which was later revealed to be jameed, a solidified Middle Eastern yogurt.</p>

<p>The jameed was shaved over the shortrib, providing a bit of saltiness and tanginess to the cut of meat. The shortrib itself was absolutely delicious; it was cooked excellently and had melt-in-your-mouth texture. The sides to this dish were okay and didn’t overwhelm the flavors of the meat <strong><em>(4/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>On the side, the parsnip puree was pungent and had crunchy nibs, but the plate itself was somewhat forgettable. The flavor of the dish, with a funk similar to an onion, lingered in your mouth <strong><em>(2/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Dessert was an amazing experience. The first tea served in a tube tasted exactly of Hubba Bubba and set the tone for the playfulness of the following dishes. Held together at the ends with just crème fraîche, the dessert was super interesting to taste <strong><em>(4/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>“Painted Dessert” was a spectacle to behold as lights dimmed and our table was shrouded with dry ice. As one chef came by, assembling the art using various components and then smashing the liquid nitrogen banana ice cream, one was just holding their breath as the choreography took place and we ate directly off the table. Additionally, every component was tasty, not too sweet, and had quite large portion sizes. The only room for improvement would be to in the depth of the individual flavors <strong><em>(4.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Lastly, we were handed a fully edible balloon of apple toffee with helium to play with. It was sweet, but the main appeal was the high-pitched voices from the helium <strong><em>(3.5/5)</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>17-02</em>, “Painted Dessert,” has to be the standout at Alinea for me. I think it really encapsulates the best of what Alinea has to offer: an immensely entertaining dish with novel ways to eat, where the selling point isn’t necessarily the intensity or complexity of its flavors, but rather the entire eating experience.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Creative" /><category term="Modern Cuisine" /><category term="Chicago" /><category term="United States of America" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
