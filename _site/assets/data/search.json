    "content"  : "\n\n\n  \n    \n      Rating\n      8.08 (taste: 7.7 · presentation: 7.7 · experience: 9.6)\n    \n    \n      Cost\n      $325pp\n    \n    \n      Location\n      Chicago, IL, USA\n    \n    \n      Head Chef\n      John Shields, Karen Urie Shields\n    \n    \n      TL;DR\n      a creative celebration of forest and sea in a casual but attentive environment\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNestled in the West Loop, stepping into Smyth, you are invited into an assuming layout with an open kitchen that lacks the stuffiness of many other Michelin starred restaurants. The wait staff are friendly and the ambience invites an air of warmth. At the time of dining, Smyth had just recently been awarded its third star.\n\nTo start off, as a precursor to the rest of the courses each with a somewhat Japanese flair, we were presented with the slightly alcoholic, fermented amazake with fruity pineapple notes and a large sprig of leaf. It was fresh, fruity, and provided good sweetness to begin with. The tart had a very strong herb flavor with the fennel and dill but it went well with the kelp and the mushier prawn. The quail egg provided a strong burst of flavor as the yolk exploded.\n\nThe following two dishes held with more seafood - the Dungeness crab bite was akin to eating fruit with a briny crab aftertaste. The crab custard, almost a chawanmushi, was one of the best courses, fusing a rich crab flavor with passionfruit for intense umami and sweetness in every bite. The following onion dish was largely forgettable, as they were roasted well and tart, but the lobster consomme did not provide too much support for flavor.\n\nThe caviar dash had a very odd presentation - it was caviar stuck to the side and slowly sliding down into the walnut sauce. In my opinion, this seemed a bit messy and unrefined; we were given almonds and rose butter to alternate enjoying the caviar with, and while they both were pleasant, the rose butter had a much stronger, richer flavor, providing decent contrast.\n\nThe palate cleanser was effective and fresh. It combined the apple, eucalyptus, and avocado to provide an earthy dish with a peanut milk bed, a bit like a vegetable ice cream. The following vegetable dish fell a bit flat. The cream sauce and pureé were just fine, if not a bit tart and the asparagus tips were done well but lacked much beyond their initial flavor. I was a big fan of the rainbow trout as its consistency was almost gelatinous, contrasted to its flaky skin and kombu. Laying atop the congee allowed the rice to soak up much of the sauce and flavor.\n\nTheir next dish was the “Lamb in Many Ways,” where the rack was notably delicious while the sausage was unremarkable but savory. The milk bread was fresh, fluffy, and warm and accompanied the lamb heart and habañero sauce well, which formed a very unique yet effective combo. I was satisfied with Smyth’s willingness to try different combinations and provide contrasting flavors, textures, and ideas to the palate.\n\nOnto dessert, the goat cheese texture was just like perfectly chilled ice cream and the tartness provided by the pineapple with the sweetness of the honey fit well. I also enjoyed the ingenuity behind the banana dish, essentially reconstructing the fruit in novel ways. The custard was strong and we were instructed to bite once into the walnut truffle, finish the “banana,” and finally revisit the truffle, keeping up its sweetness. The sweet, chewy kombu was an interesting touch.\n\nThe ganache “quail eggs” were good, but I was not a fan of the strong lemon rind flavor. The graham cracker shot had quite a neutral ganache but the flower flavor was a bit stronger than I would’ve liked. The sea lettuce caramel was strong and evoked flavors similar to that of Japanese snacks.\n\nI want to additionally point out the excellent service as handedness, towels, and dish explanations were handled with care and it was evident how attentive our waiters and waitresses were.\n\n\n\n\n"

    "content"  : "\n\n\n  \n    \n      Rating\n      8.46 (taste: 7.2 · presentation: 10 · experience: 10)\n    \n    \n      Cost\n      $435pp\n    \n    \n      Location\n      Chicago, IL, USA\n    \n    \n      Head Chef\n      Grant Achatz\n    \n    \n      TL;DR\n      engaging experience with whimsical fare that tests boundaries of gastronomy\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nFollowing a day of work, I had the opportunity to dine at Alinea. The restaurant is tucked in a relatively quiet area of Old Town with an easily overlooked facade. We were seated at The Gallery where we were brought in to a dimly lit room with a long, communal table filled with glass flora.\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    01-01: trout roe, green beans, and cream tart, cake, sunflower ball\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    01-02: vegetable wand\n  \n\n\n      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    01-03: champagne\n  \n\n\n      \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    02: garden gazpacho in glass flower, pistil spoon\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe amuse-bouche assortment was so-so, having a interesting textural contrasts between the crispy tart (itself having popping roe and and the snappy green beans), the softer cake, and the condensed sunflower ball (2/5). Next, the vegetable wand was interesting to look at, but frankly, I didn’t even get to taste this before it was whisked away (1.5/5). We were also handed a complimentary glass of champagne (2/5).\n\nLastly, the garden gazpacho was served to us within a fragile, glass-blown flower with the pistil serving as a spoon. The flowers were extremely interesting to eat out of, enhacing the idea of delicacy, but the soup was not good. The consistency was akin to shaved ice and tasted much too sharp and sour  (1/5).\n\nOf note, throughout our meal, there was a large stone fixture of a fountain containing what had been presumed to be water. After some story-telling, the waiter asked for two volunteers to assist in pouring two jugs of liquid into said fountain; I obliged, helping with the creation of a later drink.\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    03-01: cobbler with walnut cream, quince\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    03-02: with peach and country ham\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    03-03: sherry from pouring pitchers into a fountain\n  \n\n\n\n\nFollowing this, we were quickly ushered into the kitchen where we witnessed the construction of the cobbler dish. Chefs sliced cured ham, cut precise pieces of peach, and assembled a solid yet forgettable dish. It again featured contrasting textures as well as combined nuttiness, umami, and syrupy-sweetness from the walnut, ham, and peach, respectively (3/5). To compliment the dish, we were served a sherry from the fountain: our creation from just a few minutes ago (2/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    04: caviar, walnut, tapioca\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    05: apple cider, celery juice in a horseradish shell\n  \n\n\n\n\nUpon return to the gallery, the dining room is completely transformed, where it’s well lit and tables are separated. Our first dish is a palm of caviar and walnut, where custom-made glass blown “shells” serve as our plate. Briny and nutty, this was an innovative take to combine all of our senses by involving the tactility of our palms (3/5).\n\nNext was a “shot” of apple cider and celery juice in a horseradish shell. Personally, I did not enjoy the sour flavors, but it was at least interesting breaking up the horseradish “wax” shell in my mouth to reveal a cool liquid inside (1.5/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    06: potato ball speared over cold potato, truffle, parmesan, vichyssoise\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    07-01: black cod with potato chips\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    07-02: ashed onion and mint dip\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe next dish was the classic “Hot Potato Cold Potato,” and upon removing the spear, you get a sharp contrast of textures and temperatures in a buttery, comforting, and yet fleeting slurp. The combination of the vichyssoise, Parmesan, truffle and potato forms was very imaginative and it was made clear why this is a staple (4.5/5).\n\nNext we had the black cod with potato chips and onion and mint dip. It was smoky and soft, and the onion dip was addictive (4/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    08-01: &#39;sardine&#39; eggplants\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    08-02: butter over rye crisp\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    08-03: herbs\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    08-04: egg yolk and pickled vegetables\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    08-05: assembled crisp\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe subsequent “sardine” eggplants were quite tough and while an interesting concept, it fell short on the flavor department for me. Savory and atop a buttery crisp, it felt difficult to eat (1.5/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    09-01: biscuit hidden within golden duck\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    09-02: with blueberry jam, foie gras\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe biscuit was warm, buttery, and flaky. The two jams provided good contrast with sweetness, tartness, and richness (3.5/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    10: squab with dried vegetables, rehydrated in jous\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    11: chicken wing with sesame seeds and gooseberry sauce, gooseberry with matsutake mushrooms, rice block with uni and gooseberry\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe squab was perfectly cooked, hitting on its tenderness and flavor. It had the right amount of gaminess and the rehydrating jous was rich and umami, providing textural contrast when the crunchy vegetables were applied (4.5/5).\n\nThe next set of courses were gooseberry themed, and for the uni they again brought out a tactile bowl for an interesting sensation. All three played on the use of sweetness and savoriness, with my only complaint being my desire for a napkin after the chicken wing. Otherwise, the individual ingredients really stood out, with the individual rice granules tasted and the mushrooms having natural fungal flavor and bite (4/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    12: black truffle, romaine lettuce, parmesan, all encased in pasta\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    13: venison, rabbit, apple, onion, served with a stick on fire\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe following was another Alinea classic called the “Truffle Explosion,” where we were advised to eat with our mouths shut to get all of the flavor. This truly lived up to the hype; inside was a decadent amount of truffle juice, with the other ingredients primarily providing texture (4.5/5).\n\nThis was followed up with a stranger looking dish consisting of a fried meatball attached to a flaming stick. The meatball consisted of numerous different meats, apple, and onion, but for me, the flavors mixed a bit together. The presentation was interesting, if not a little out of place, and the seasoning was done well, but this was not a standout (3/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    14-01: Australian wagyu short rib, parsnip chip, saffron dot, turnip mash\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    14-02: jameed\n  \n\n\n\n\nNext, we were introduced to dishes that relied heavily on parsnip flavor. First, we were presented with a plate of wagyu short rib and various root vegetable chips and mash. Next, we were introduced to a mysterious large white mound which was later revealed to be jameed, a solidified Middle Eastern yogurt.\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    14-03: shaved jameed atop short rib\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    15: parsnip pureé with roasted onion\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe jameed was shaved over the shortrib, providing a bit of saltiness and tanginess to the cut of meat. The shortrib itself was absolutely delicious; it was cooked excellently and had melt-in-your-mouth texture. The sides to this dish were okay and didn’t overwhelm the flavors of the meat (4/5).\n\nOn the side, the parsnip puree was pungent and had crunchy nibs, but the plate itself was somewhat forgettable. The flavor of the dish, with a funk similar to an onion, lingered in your mouth (2/5).\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    16: Hubba Bubba infused tea, tapioca pearls, crème fraîche, hibiscus jam, thai long peppercorn\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    17-02: liquid nitrogen banana ice cream, strawberry and banana cream with chocolate sauce, pineapple turnover cake with butterscotch crumbs\n  \n\n\n   \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    18: green apple toffee balloon, helium\n  \n\n\n\n\nDessert was an amazing experience. The first tea served in a tube tasted exactly of Hubba Bubba and set the tone for the playfulness of the following dishes. Held together at the ends with just crème fraîche, the dessert was super interesting to taste (4/5).\n\n“Painted Dessert” was a spectacle to behold as lights dimmed and our table was shrouded with dry ice. As one chef came by, assembling the art using various components and then smashing the liquid nitrogen banana ice cream, one was just holding their breath as the choreography took place and we ate directly off the table. Additionally, every component was tasty, not too sweet, and had quite large portion sizes. The only room for improvement would be to in the depth of the individual flavors (4.5/5).\n\nLastly, we were handed a fully edible balloon of apple toffee with helium to play with. It was sweet, but the main appeal was the high-pitched voices from the helium (3.5/5).\n\n\n\nBBB\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    17-02: liquid nitrogen banana ice cream, strawberry and banana cream with chocolate sauce, pineapple turnover cake with butterscotch crumbs\n  \n\n\n17-02, “Painted Dessert,” has to be the standout at Alinea for me. I think it really encapsulates the best of what Alinea has to offer: an immensely entertaining dish with novel ways to eat, where the selling point isn’t necessarily the intensity or complexity of its flavors, but rather the entire eating experience.\n"
